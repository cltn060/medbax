# Marketing & Landing Page Design Identity

This document outlines the design language and visual identity for MedBax's marketing and landing pages.

## Core Philosophical Identity
**"Superhuman Medical Staff"**
The design aims to evoke a sense of advanced intelligence, clinical precision, and futuristic capability while remaining approachable and trustworthy.

## Visual Language

### 1. Typography
- **Primary Headings:** `Kalice Regular` (Custom Serif)
  - Used for hero statements and major section headers to provide a premium, authoritative feel.
- **Secondary/Body:** `Inter` (Sans-serif)
  - Used for readability, technical details, and navigation.
- **Attributes:** Medium to light weights, tracking is tight for headings (`tracking-tight`) and wide for navigation (`tracking-wide`).

### 2. Color Palette
The interface uses a sophisticated blend of deep neutrals and celestial accents.

| Tone | Dark Mode | Light Mode | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Background** | `black` (#000000) | `slate-50` (#f8fafc) | Main page sections |
| **Accent 1** | `indigo-500` | `indigo-600` | Primary actions, glows, star effects |
| **Accent 2** | `blue-500` | `blue-400` | Gradient blends, secondary effects |
| **Text (Primary)** | `white` | `slate-900` | Headings, labels |
| **Text (Secondary)** | `zinc-400` | `slate-600` | Descriptions, subtitles |

### 3. Glassmorphism & Depth
- **Surface:** `white/95` (Dark) or `white/70` (Light) with `backdrop-blur-xl`.
- **Borders:** Subtle `white/10` or `slate-200/60` borders to define card edges without heavy shadows.
- **Shadows:** Deep, soft shadows for elevated elements (e.g., `shadow-2xl`).

### 4. Motion & Special Effects
- **Twinkle & Glow:** Pulsing stars (`animate-twinkle`) and glowing backgrounds (`blur-[100px]`) create a "celestial" or "ethereal" medical atmosphere.
- **Dust Float:** Micro-animations for background particles to add life without distraction.
- **Scroll Reveal:** Components fade and slide into view as the user scrolls, emphasizing growth and discovery.

## Key Components
- **The "Fan of Cards":** Dynamic, rotating cards at the hero base representing different AI capabilities.
- **Orbital Team Section:** Visualizing the AI as a central "sun" with clinical features orbiting it.
- **Pricing Cards:** Minimalist, high-contrast cards with clear tier differentiation.
